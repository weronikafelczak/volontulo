## Developer setup

For developers' convenience we are supporting two widely used virtualization platforms: **Docker** and **Vagrant**.

### Docker

To run our application in development mode You need to have **Docker** and **Docker Compose**.

That's the easiest way to setup environment - from downloaded source code run
```
docker-compose up
```
and point your browser to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) and [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)

### Vagrant

To run our application in Vagrant:

* provision and start Vagrant container
```
vagrant up
```
* SSH into it (do it twice, for backend and frontend)
```
vagrant ssh
```
* run backend
```
cd /home/ubuntu/backend
python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```
* run frontend
```
cd /home/ubuntu/frontend
ng serve --open --host=0.0.0.0
```
* point your browser to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) and [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)

### Manual project set up

For manual installation You can follow `Dockerfile`/`etc/vagrant-install.sh` instructions.

For Your convenience we suggest to use **virtualenv** and `backend/volontulo_org/settings/dev_local.py` (as it use SQLite instead of PostgreSQL).

## Initial admin credentials
 * **user**: admin@volontuloapp.org
 * **pass**: stx123

## Instances

* dev (https://dev.volontulo.pl)
* RC (https://rc.volontulo.pl)
* production (https://volontulo.pl)

## Release cycles definition

Working agreement:

* We work in 6-weeks sprints. Code is pushed to the dev instance after merging and passing tests.
* Code freeze at the end of the 5th week. Regression tests can be started after pushing the release branch to release candidate instance. 
* Regression lasts for one week and all of the regression bugs, that have been found, should be fixed with highest priority in week 6.
* Afterwards application is to be tested and approved by the client. 
* Sign-off from the client means that we push the code to the production after week 6.


## Responsive design breakpoints

Angular implementation use extensively Bootstrap 4 - we will comply with [standard Bootstrap 4 breakpoints described on its website](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/overview/#responsive-breakpoints).
